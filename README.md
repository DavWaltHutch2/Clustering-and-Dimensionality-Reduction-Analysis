# Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Analysis 

This project reviews how dimensionality reduction algorithms and clustering algorithms can be used together to gain insights in unsupervised learning.  To review a detailed summary of analysis view "Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction Analysis.pdf".  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.  

### Prerequisites

To run the code you will need the R Statistical software installed on your local machine.  The code will automatically check for necessary R-packages and download any that are missing. 


### Installation

1.  Clone codebase to local machine
2.  Set working directory in R to directory labeled "code" 
3.  Run code
